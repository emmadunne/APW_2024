# Palaeodiversity in R

> Indeed, there are many things that we might never know about extinct species, such as their true geographic range or abundances. But, for now, we should view our knowledge of the history of life on Earth as a work in progress - *Roger Benson* (2018)

## Purpose

This repository contains all materials for Module 2 of the Analytical Paleobiology Workshop. There are three main parts to this class and each one has an associated exercise in R:

1. **Databases in Paleobiology** - available databases, futurproofing, accessing the Paleobiology Database and importing datasets into R
2. **Fossil record data structure** - exploring the impact of heterogeneous data structures (biases) on estimates of diversity through visualisations and simple statistics
3. **Sampling standardisation** - Rarefaction/Extrapolation curves, coverage-based rarefaction with iNEXT, Shareholder Quorum Subsampling (SQS), and squares

## Using this repo

To use the files within this repository, you can simply download it as a .zip file to your computer and work with it from there. Or you can 'fork' it, which creates a copy of it for you to use without making changes to this original one

- To download this repo as a .zip file, click the green 'Code' button and the 'Download ZIP'. Be sure to place your downloaded folder someone sensible on your own computer!
- For instructions on how to set up git to use it through RStudio, see [this tutorial](https://jennybc.github.io/2014-05-12-ubc/ubc-r/session03_git.html)
- To 'fork' and 'clone' this repo and open it in RStudio, see [this tutorial](https://github.com/rstats-tln/fork-and-clone-repo)


## Workflow

1. **R packages**: Before we begin, ensure that you have all of the associated R packages installed and loaded. You will find a list of them in script 0. 

2. **Code**: Scripts 1-3 are in chronological order â€” we will start at 1 and proceed through 2 and 3 across the course of the day
